## Overview
This document outlines the evaluation and security requirements specification for the OpenWeatherMap API,a weather forecast tool. We will focusi on data sharing, scraping, and connectivity between Python-based applications and external data formats such as XML, JSON, and SQL.

## API Evaluation Summary
The OpenWeatherMap API allows  access to real-time and historical weather data. Data is primarily  in JSON format, making it a popular choice for data wrangling tasks in Python.

### Key Features:
- JSON-based RESTful interface
- API key authentication
- Granular endpoints for weather types

## Security Specification

| Requirement                          | Purpose                                                       | Risk Mitigated                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **API Key Management**              | Use environment variables or secret vaults to store API keys   | Prevent key exposure and unauthorized use      |
| **Rate Limiting Awareness**         | Respect API usage quotas to avoid service interruption         | Avoid throttling and account suspension        |
| **HTTPS Enforcement**              | Ensure all connections to API use HTTPS                        | Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks              |
| **Data Validation on Input/Output** | Use validation libraries like `pydantic` or `jsonschema`       | Avoid injection attacks and data corruption    |
| **Error Logging and Monitoring**    | Log failed requests and use retry logic                        | Debug issues without exposing sensitive info   |
| **SQL Injection Mitigation**        | Use ORM tools or parameterized queries for SQL connectivity    | Prevent SQL injection via scraped content      |

## File Format and Management System Integration

### JSON
- Natively supported by the API
- Can be handled with Python libraries such as `requests`, `json`, and `pandas`


###  XML
- Requires additional parsing with `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml`
- Security: disable external entity resolution (XXE prevention)

### SQL
- Ability to stramline to databases with tools such as `sqlite3`, or `pandas.to_sql`
- Security: sanitize data before insertion, validate types, use secure credentials
